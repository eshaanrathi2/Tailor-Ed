The grading system aligns with the SJSU Catalog’s \"Grading System\" (often referred to as \\'The Grading System\\'), which follows a differential grading scale to fairly assess student performance across multiple dimensions.\\n\\n\\n**Grading Scale and Assignment Weightage**\\n\\n- Final Project: 25% - This paper will be evaluated based on the following criteria, each with a maximum score of 10 points:\\n\\n  1. **Clarity (3 pts.)**: The paper must convey its thesis or central argument clearly.\\n\\n  2. **Organization (3 pts.)**: Arguments should be well-structured and logically sequenced.\\n\\n  3. Written Expression (3 pts.): Writing style, grammar, and mechanics are essential for a professional presentation.\\n\\n  4. **Evidence & Analysis (2 pts.)**: The paper must demonstrate critical engagement with texts using evidence effectively.\\n\\n  5. Originality (3 pts.): Submission should showcase unique insights or perspectives on the topic.\\n\\n- Quizzes/Assignments: 20% - These will be assessed based on accuracy, comprehension, and application of course materials.\\n\\n- Course Participation and Engagement (15%): Active participation in class discussions reflects a student’s commitment to the learning process.\\n\\n- Portfolio Review: 10% - A compilation of work throughout the semester will be reviewed for progress, growth, and depth of understanding.\\n\\n- Midterm Examination: 25% - This examination will cover key concepts learned in class, ensuring students have mastered foundational knowledge.\\n\\n\\n**Grade Reduction Policy**\\n\\nIf a student\\'s final grade falls below an A-, it will be immediately reduced by one letter grade to reflect the course performance accurately. The grading scale is as follows:\\n\\n- A (90-100): Excellent mastery of content and exceptional analytical skills.\\n\\n- B+ (83-89): High proficiency with minor areas for improvement.\\n\\n- B (78-82): Competent understanding with notable strengths and some weaknesses.\\n\\n- C+ (73-77): Average performance, though there are clear deficiennas in critical thinking or evidence application.\\n\\n- D (69-72): Below average; significant improvement is required to reach basic competence levels.\\n\\n- F (<68): Failure to meet the minimum standards of comprehension and analysis for this course level.\\n\\n\\n**Grading System Features:**\\n\\n1. **Differential Grading Scale:** The SJSU Catalog specifies different ranges for letter grades, reflecting varying degrees of mastery over course content.\\n\\n2. **Comprehensive Assessment:** Each component (final project, quizzes, participation) contributes to the overall grade, ensuring a well-rounded evaluation of student performance.\\n\\n3. **Proactive Feedback:** Through assignments and exams, students receive continual feedback on their learning progress.\\n\\n4. **Grade Reduction Policy:** This policy maintains academic rigor by penalizing underperformance to ensure that grades accurately represent a student\\'s understanding of the course material.<|end|><|endoftext|>'"
